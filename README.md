## Features

*   **Automated Redemption:** Automatically detects and redeems assets marked as "FREE" on any search or category page.
*   **Licence Type Selection for FAB** You can choose the type of licence (Personal / Professional) you want.**
*   **Draggable Liquid Glass UI:** A beautiful, semi-transparent interface that can be moved anywhere on the screen. It follows modern design principles for a clean and intuitive feel.
*   **High-Contrast Readability:** Text is enhanced with a subtle shadow, ensuring it remains perfectly clear and legible on both light and dark website backgrounds.
*   **Real-time Progress:** The UI displays the name of the asset currently being redeemed and a progress counter (`current/total`).
*   **Automatic Page Navigation:** Once all free assets on a page are redeemed, the script will automatically click the "Next" button to continue to the next page.
*   **Searchable Asset List:** After a session, you can view a complete list of all assets you've redeemed. This list includes a search bar to quickly find specific assets.
*   **Simple Controls:** Easily start, stop, expand, and collapse the UI with simple clicks.

## Usage

1.  **Navigate to the Unity Asset Store / FAB:** Go to any search results, category, or publisher page that lists multiple assets.
2.  **Locate the UI:** The Liquid Glass UI will appear in the top-right corner of the page.
3.  **Interact with the UI:**
    *   **Move:** Click and drag the panel to move it anywhere on the screen.
    *   **Expand/Collapse:** Click the panel (when not dragging) to expand it for more options or collapse it to a compact view.
    *   **Start/Stop:** In the expanded view, click the **Start Auto Redeem** button to begin the process. The button will change to **Stop Process**, which you can click at any time to halt the script.
    *   **View List:** After one or more assets have been redeemed, a **View Redeemed** button will appear. Click it to see a list of what you've grabbed during the session.
    *   **Search:** Use the search bar within the list view to filter your redeemed assets by name. Click the **'✖'** button to return to the main expanded view.

**For FAB** You should scroll down the page. This will allow you to directly add items to the list, which will then be displayed on the counter as "Found: 15 assets".
